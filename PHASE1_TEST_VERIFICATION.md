}
```

## 2. Webhook Handling ✅

### API Endpoint: `/api/webhooks/stripe`

- ✅ Email notification trigger
- ✅ Error handling (graceful degradation for email failures)

**Security:**

---

## 3. Order Creation ✅

### Service: Order Service
- **File:** `src/lib/order-service.ts`
- **Status:** ✅ Verified

**Features Verified:**
- ✅ Unique order number generation (`ORD-{timestamp}-{random}`)
- ✅ Order creation with all details:
  - User ID
  - Order items with snapshots
  - Shipping address
  - Pricing breakdown (subtotal, shipping, tax, total)
  - Currency code
  - Stripe session ID
- ✅ Order status set to `PENDING`
- ✅ Product inventory decrement
- ✅ User cart clearing after order
- ✅ Full order data returned with relationships

**Order Workflow:**
```
PENDING → PROCESSING → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
         ↓
      CANCELLED (if not shipped)
```

**Inventory Management:**
- ✅ Decrements on order creation
- ✅ Restores on order cancellation
- ✅ Prevents cancellation if shipped/delivered

---

## 4. Email Notifications ✅

### Service: Email Service
- **File:** `src/lib/email.ts`
- **Status:** ✅ Verified

**Email Templates Implemented:**

**Integration Points:**

## 5. End-to-End Flow Verification ✅

### Complete Payment Flow:

```
1. User adds items to cart
   └─> Cart stored in localStorage + database

2. User proceeds to checkout
   └─> POST /api/checkout
       └─> Validates cart, address, auth
       └─> Creates Stripe checkout session
       └─> Redirects to Stripe

3. User completes payment on Stripe
   └─> Stripe sends webhook event

4. Webhook received
   └─> POST /api/webhooks/stripe
       └─> Verifies signature
       └─> Extracts session data
       └─> Creates order (order-service)
           └─> Generates order number
           └─> Saves order to database
           └─> Decrements product inventory
           └─> Clears user cart
       └─> Sends confirmation email
       └─> Returns success

5. User redirected to success page
   └─> /checkout/success?session_id={ID}
       └─> Displays order confirmation
       └─> Links to order history

6. Order appears in user dashboard
   └─> /dashboard/orders
       └─> Shows all order details
       └─> Allows cancellation (if pending)
```
